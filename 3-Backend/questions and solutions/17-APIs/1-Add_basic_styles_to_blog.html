          Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us would
          reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
          attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of front-end
          development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
        </p>

        <p>
          However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end design and
          web development
        </p>

        <ol>

          <li>
            <h4> Commenting </h4>
            <p>
              Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are
              written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With
              proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
              things are at and how they work.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4> Invest In Productive Tools. </h4>
            <p>
              The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the
              amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools that’ll
              help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, GitHub,
              Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Always Be Curious. </h4>
            <p>
              A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and
              innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end
              development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful
              learning sources for front-end developers -

            </ul>
            <p>
              Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These meet-ups provide excellent opportunities
              to expand your network and get acquainted with talented people.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Refactor Your Code From Time To Time. </h4>
            <p>
              By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. This
              will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your code
              will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from that, one
              of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code remains free from
              plagiarism.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Automate! </h4>
            <p>
              As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get overwhelming
              at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency
              management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can take care
              of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of front-end development
              such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing
              so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use your time to focus on the
              areas that’ll improve the overall functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very
              efficient automation tools.
            </p>

        </ol>
        <p>
          While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always
          remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your
          signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end development.
