          <p>
            Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also
            governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over
            decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than
            their founders expect.
          </p>

          <p>
            Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for
            different purposes. Thus, some static do’s and don’ts are always of
            use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has
            three common features: maintainability, dependability, and
            usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even
            in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few
            prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid
            foundation on which readable code can be written.
          </p>

          <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

          <p>
            This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these,
            a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites
            that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like
            design and architecture. An important question is how development is
            structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The
            problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the
            developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such
            basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being
            written.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design
            and architecture. Either a code is so simple that there are
            obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no
            obvious errors. Software design is also of importance to clients,
            who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If
            there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then
            those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed design is
            a good guide for coding.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next step is to measure existing programming languages against
            the requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed
            routine can be adopted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established
            good coding practices.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
              <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
                programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
                programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge
                transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description
                of the module, original author, modifications and authors who
                modified code with a description on why it was modified were
                components of an early commenting practice.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
              <p>
                Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding.
                Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not
                replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion
                and utter waste of time, descriptive names should be used.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
              <p>
                The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain
                result, developers may use complex logic but this should be
                minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses
                the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even
                completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple code
                does not always depend on the length of the code. The code must
                also be conceptually simple. An added advantage is if the code
                is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and
                programmer keystrokes can be reduced.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
              <p>
                Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code
                contains values referring to ‘absolute parameters’ such as file
                names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is
                of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize these
                variables and configure them so the application can also be run
                and maintained in a different environment.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>TESTING</h3>
              <p>
                Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test
                cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they
                are developed while an application is coded.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
              <p>
                While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors
                throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be
                debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck
                for longer programmes. The best practice, therefore, is to debug
                each module as soon as it has been created.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
              <p>
                Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
                installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated
                regularly. Unused code or anything that is not necessary should
                not be installed.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce
            risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of
            these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled
            programmer writing numerous codes, all these guidelines will come in
            handy. Since codes can run up to millions of lines at times,
            outdated advice like ‘keep it simple’ or ‘less is more’ is priceless
            and should always be remembered.
